# News Parser
It is a test task by Gap intelligence. The goal of the application is parsing headlines of one of the websites with the links.


# About Challenge
You follow the news in the IT world on multiple websites. However, it takes time to follow the news on different resources. You got an idea to create a web-based application that fulfills the following requirements:
Parses headlines of one of your favorite websites
Stores parsed headlines in a database (PostgreSQL) 
Lists the saved headlines in historical order using ReactJS library.
Adds test coverage using rspec/jests (optional)

The application does not need to:
Handle authentication or authorization
Be aesthetically pleasing

Parser
Parser needs to parse the headline and link to the full article at least from one web resource. Parsing can be initiated manually or configured to run automatically by specified schedule.

Data
The parsed data along with parsed datetime must be saved in a database. The database should store only unique records.

View
The view must leverage a ReactJS component that will display a list of headlines in historical order, the newest first. Clicking the headline must navigate to an external web resource to the full article webpage.

Installation
This application is designed to be run locally on the Rails development server with a PostgreSQL database.
